# LSTM
Text Generation Using LSTM

**Dependencies:**:
Spacy, Keras, Numpy

Description:
In this Repository, we will learn how to generate text using LSTM.

What is LSTM?
It is a special type of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies.

"Long short-term memory (LSTM) units are units of a recurrent neural network (RNN). An RNN composed of LSTM units is often called an LSTM network. A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate. The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell"

Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of deep learning model that is mostly used for analysis of sequential data (time series data prediction).

There are different application areas that are used: Language model, Neural machine translation, Music generation, Time series prediction, Financial prediction, Robot control, Time series prediction, Speech recognition, Rhythm learning, Music composition, Grammar learning, Handwriting recognition, Human action recognition, Sign Language Translation,Time series anomaly detection, Several prediction tasks in the area of business process management, Prediction in medical care pathways, Semantic parsing, Object Co-segmentation.

LSTM was proposed in 1997 by Sepp Hochreiter and JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber and improved in 2000 by Felix Gers' team. Paper
